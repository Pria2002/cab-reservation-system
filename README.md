# 🚖 Cab Reservation System

Welcome to the **Cab Reservation System** – a simple Java-based console application that helps users easily book cabs, and allows admins to manage bookings, cab details, and users.

This project is great for understanding **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts, **file handling**, and **basic Java application design**.
